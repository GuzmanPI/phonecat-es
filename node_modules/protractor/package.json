  "readme": "Protractor [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/angular/protractor.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/angular/protractor)\n==========\n\nProtractor is an end-to-end test framework for [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) applications. Protractor is a [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) program built on top of [WebDriverJS](https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/WebDriverJs). Protractor runs tests against your application running in a real browser, interacting with it as a user would. \n\n\nGetting Started\n---------------\n\nThe Protractor documentation for users is located in the [protractor/docs](https://github.com/angular/protractor/tree/master/docs) folder.\n\nTo get set up and running  quickly:\n - Work through the [Tutorial](https://github.com/angular/protractor/blob/master/docs/tutorial.md)\n - Take a look at the [Table of Contents](https://github.com/angular/protractor/blob/master/docs/toc.md)\n\nOnce you are familiar with the tutorial, youâ€™re ready to move on. To modify your environment, see the Protractor Setup docs. To start writing tests, see the Protractor Tests docs.\n\nTo better understand how Protractor works with the Selenium WebDriver and Selenium Sever see the reference materials.\n\n\nFor Contributors\n----------------\nClone the github repository:\n\n    git clone https://github.com/angular/protractor.git\n    cd protractor\n    npm install\n\nStart up a selenium server. By default, the tests expect the selenium server to be running at `http://localhost:4444/wd/hub`.\n\nProtractor's test suite runs against the included test application. Start that up with\n\n    npm start\n\nThen run the tests with\n\n    npm test\n",
